# Obstacle-Detection-Car

## Overview
This project is an Arduino-based smart vehicle designed to detect obstacles and prevent collisions automatically.

## Components Used
- Arduino
- Ultrasonic/IR Sensor
- Motor Driver
- DC Motors
- Battery

## Working
The sensor continuously measures distance. When an obstacle is detected within a threshold range, the motor stops to avoid collision.

## What I Learned
- Sensor integration
- Circuit design
- Microcontroller programming
- Troubleshooting hardware
